# Case Study on A.I. in Construction: construct**connect**&reg;
## Overview and Origin
**Name of company:** construct**connect**&reg;

**Incorporated:** in 2016

**Founders:** construct**connect**&reg; was founded in 2016 through the merger of several construction software companies, including iSqFt, BidClerk, Construction Data and CMD Group. The person heading A.I. is CTO Doug Dockery.

**Basis of the Idea:** The basis of the idea for construct**connect**&reg; was to create an all-inclusive solution that takes advantage of data and technology to streamline the way construction bidding, improve project visibility, and establish clear goals and roles among industry stakeholders.

**Funding:** construct**connect**&reg; has been funded through its parent companies and investments from various venture capital firms: specific funding details are not publicly disclosed.

## Business Activities
**Problem-Solving:** construct**connect**&reg; helps with common problems of the construction sector such as, poor communication among stakeholders, insuficient project data, and poor bidding procedures.

**Intended Customers:** The intended customers are General Contractors, subcontractors, manufacturers, service providers, and Suppliers & Distributors.

**Solution Driven:** construct**connect**&reg; offers a suite of products that integrate A.I. and data analytics to provide real-time project leads, bid management, takeoff and estimating solutions, and detailed construction market analysis. Their A.I. driven tools help automate and optimize various charasteristics of the construction process, making it more efficient for contractors to find and win projects.

**Technologies Used:** Machine Learning is used for predictive analytics nd project lead generation. NLP is used to analyze and process data from contruction plans and documents.
(I am familiar with this as we use it with OnScreenTake off to mesure floors and walls for the installation of stone and synthetic material).To add, cloud computing is used to store data and the processing of data, data analysis, and automate complex tasks. 
## Landscape
**Field:** Construction

**Major Trends and Innovations:** For the last ten years, construction has seen a plethera of advancements in A.I., including the use of predictive maintenance (PdM), construction Takeoff (this is what is used to determine the amount of materials and labor needed to complete a job), A.I. project management and scheduling tools.

**Competitors:** Procore, PlanGrid, and Autodesk Constructoion Cloud.
## Results:
One of the results that I have seen, is the use of On-Screen Takeoff.  This A.I. enhanced software has helped our project manages do a quick turn around on bidding jobs, collecting material count and keeping track of work progress.
## Recommendations
A suggestion I would have, would be to use A.I. to fill in or create the take offs automatically by the only intervention of the user is to fill in the call outs needed in different colors. Diffferent colors for different matterial.

**Benifits:** This will expidite the transition from CAD drawing or PDF to a digital take off and create what takes time for a user to create by hand. To be able to call out all sheets with specific material.

**Technologies Used:** 
- Computer Vision - to decipher call out placement and distinguish between call outs related to areas when doing a takeoff. 

**Appropriateness:** The use of Computer vision along with other A.I. technologies can accurately and quickly help a project manager or estimater with sorting out blueprints in finding things such as floors, walls, windows, doors, countertops, fixtures other items used for takeoffs, bidding, estimating, procurement and labor costs.
